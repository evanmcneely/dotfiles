# Dotfiles

Likely only works on macOS but ðŸ¤·.

## Usage

Run the command `stow <pkg name>` with the name of the package you want to use (requires [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)).

## Fresh setup

Todo

## Other

Firenvim [Chorme plugin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/egpjdkipkomnmjhjmdamaniclmdlobbo)

## Possibilities

- now that we are using `stow` we could use the `dot-` notation in file names with the `--dotfiles` flag
